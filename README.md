# Image Classification with Logistic Regression

## Project Overview
This project implements a binary image classification model using logistic regression. The aim is to classify images into two categories using a simple yet effective machine-learning algorithm.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of grayscale images of size 64x64 pixels. Each picture belongs to one of two classes.

## Preprocessing
- Images are resized to 64x64 pixels.
- Converted to grayscale and flattened into a 1D array.

## Model
A logistic regression model is trained on the preprocessed images.

## Results
- Accuracy: 0.85
- Confusion Matrix:
